      <h3>Beacon</h3>
      <p>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/specification">Beacon</a> is an open technical 
        standard for discovery of genetic variants and their annotations. Beacon is developed by 
        the Global Alliance for Genomics & Health (<a target="_blank" href="http://ga4gh.org">GA4GH</a>).</p>
      <h3>COVID-19 Beacon</h3>
      <p>
        The COVID-19 Beacon is a service that enables discovery of genetic variants that have 
        been identified in genomes of the COVID-19 virus and associated information (e.g. location).
      </p>
      <h3>Searching the COVID-19 Beacon</h3>
      <p>
        To search the COVID-19 Beacon, enter information about the 
        variant of interest (genome position, reference and alternate allele) and click the search button. 
        Information about variants that are aggregated by this service will be listed. This service may not 
        aggregate all available datasets.
      </p>
      <h3>Partnering</h3>
      <p>
        This service is intended to help share data on COVID-19 as broadly as possible, connecting 
        a global ecosystem of data generators and researchers. For assistance on making genome sequence 
        data available through this service or using it for your analyses, please contact us using 
        the information below.
